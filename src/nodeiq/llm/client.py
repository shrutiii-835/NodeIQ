"""The OpenAI client: the one module in NodeIQ allowed to talk to OpenAI.

Implements Phase 6C exactly: a pure communication layer over the
official OpenAI Python SDK. This module knows how to authenticate, send
a prompt, retry transient failures, time out, and translate every SDK
failure into one of `nodeiq.llm.exceptions`' project-specific
exceptions. It knows nothing about Linux, snapshots, collectors, the
coordinator, the Summary Engine, the Report Formatter, or CLI argument
parsing — it consumes exactly the `Prompt` shape
`nodeiq.llm.prompt.build_prompt()` already returns
(`{"system": ..., "user": ..., "prompt_version": ...}`) and never
rebuilds, modifies, or re-engineers it.

Architecture (unchanged from docs/prompt_builder_design.md):

    Prompt Builder  ->  OpenAI Client  ->  Assistant response

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is read **only** in this module — nowhere else in
NodeIQ reads that environment variable. It is never logged, never
printed, never included in an exception message, and never serialized
into a snapshot, summary, report, or prompt.

Typical usage:

    from nodeiq.llm.prompt import build_prompt
    from nodeiq.llm.client import ask_openai

    prompt = build_prompt(question, evidence)
    answer = ask_openai(prompt)

`ask` asks short, evidence-grounded technical questions about a single
snapshot — not open-ended, long-form, or highly creative tasks — so a
smaller, fast, inexpensive model is a better fit than a frontier
flagship model: lower latency (a better CLI experience), lower per-call
cost (important for a tool meant to be run repeatedly during normal
operations work), and more than enough reasoning ability for
"restate/compare facts already given," which is all this system's
guardrails (docs/prompt_builder_design.md Section 10) ever ask the
model to do. If a future need for stronger reasoning is demonstrated,
this is the one constant to change.

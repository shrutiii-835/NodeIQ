"""Summary Engine: turns a raw snapshot into one concise Summary.

Implements the design in docs/summary_engine_design.md, with two
refinements agreed for this phase: the per-section structured-facts
field is called `evidence` (kept deliberately concise — see below), and
every section additionally carries a deterministic `status` — one of
`"healthy"`, `"warning"`, `"critical"`, or `"unknown"` — computed only
from fixed, named-constant thresholds. This engine never diagnoses,
never recommends, and never speculates: every `status`/`concerns` value
is a transparent function of a number already present in the snapshot
and a threshold written in this file, nothing else.

Mirrors the collector/coordinator architecture one layer up (see
docs/summary_engine_design.md Section 6): one pure `_summarize_<section>`
function per snapshot section, orchestrated by `summarize_snapshot()`,
which never lets one section's summarizer crash the whole Summary — the
same last-resort safety net `nodeiq.core.coordinator.run_scan()` already
applies to collectors.

Typical usage:

    from nodeiq.core.snapshot import load_latest_snapshot
    from nodeiq.summary import summarize_snapshot

    summary = summarize_snapshot(load_latest_snapshot())

`nodeiq.core.coordinator` and `nodeiq.core.snapshot` never import this
module, and this module never imports either of them — it depends only
on the plain dict shape they already produce (see
docs/summary_engine_design.md Section 2).

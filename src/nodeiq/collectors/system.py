"""System metadata collector.

Answers the most basic operational question NodeIQ can ask: "what machine
is this, and what is it running?" This is deliberately the first real
collector built (see docs/system_collector.md) — its whole point is to
validate the CollectorContext -> collect() -> CollectorResult pattern with
real Linux commands and real files, before any other collector is built
on top of the same pattern.

v1 scope is intentionally narrow: hostname, operating_system,
kernel_version, architecture, uptime_seconds. See docs/system_collector.md
for which fields were deliberately deferred and why.

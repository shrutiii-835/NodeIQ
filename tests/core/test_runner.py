"""Tests for nodeiq.core.runner.run_command.

Rather than depending on Linux-only commands like `df` or `systemctl`
(which may not exist on the machine running these tests — see
DECISIONS.md ADR-002 for why development happens in a Multipass VM, but
tests themselves should still run anywhere Python does), these tests use
the currently-running Python interpreter itself as the "external command."
This makes exit code, timing, and output fully predictable without
depending on any particular operating system or installed tool.

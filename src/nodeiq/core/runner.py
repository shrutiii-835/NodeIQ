"""Safe execution of external commands.

Every collector needs to run a Linux command (`df`, `systemctl`,
`journalctl`, ...) and read back what it printed. `run_command` is the one
place in NodeIQ that actually does this, so every collector shares the same
safety guarantees instead of each reimplementing them slightly differently.

See LEARNING_NOTES.md for a beginner-friendly explanation of `subprocess`,
why `shell=True` is avoided, stdout vs. stderr, exit codes, and timeouts.

    """Run an external command and capture everything about what happened.

    `command` must be a list of strings, e.g. `["df", "-h"]` — never a
    single string. This is what lets `subprocess` run the program directly
    (`shell=False`, the default) instead of through a shell, which avoids
    an entire class of shell-injection bugs: there is no shell here to
    misinterpret spaces, quotes, or special characters in a value that
    might contain them.

    Output is decoded as text with `errors="replace"`, so a command that
    happens to print a byte sequence that isn't valid UTF-8 (rare, but
    possible with real system logs) never crashes this function either —
    the invalid bytes are replaced rather than raising.

    This function never raises an exception for anything that can go wrong
    while actually *running* the command — a missing program, a timeout, or
    any other OS-level failure is reported back as a `CommandResult` with
    `error` or `timed_out` set, not as a raised exception. This is what
    lets a collector call this function without needing its own
    try/except for every possible way a subprocess can fail. The only
    exception this function *does* raise is `InvalidCommandError`, and only
    for a programmer mistake (passing something that isn't a valid command)
    rather than anything the operating system did.

    Args:
        command: The program and its arguments, as separate list items.
        timeout: Maximum seconds to let the command run before it's killed
            and treated as timed out.

    Returns:
        A `CommandResult` describing exactly what happened.
